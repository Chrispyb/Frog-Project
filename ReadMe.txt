NOTE:This program is still in early stages of development.

Overview:
This Program allows users to create training, validation, and test set files, specifically for sound classification.
These files can be used to train deep feed forward neural networks using the network and interface classes in the same program.

The program interface is a shell with the following commands:

1:Create a network
2:Load a Network from the file System
3:Save the Current Network
4:Delete the Current Network
5:Train Current Neural Network
6:Test Neural Network
7:Digital Signal Processing Interface
8:Save Network as verilog file
9:Print as C code
10:Print to a file
11:Automate Testing/Training
